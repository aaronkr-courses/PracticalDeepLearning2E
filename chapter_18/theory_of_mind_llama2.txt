>>> Mary told Amanda that she was in love with John. Amanda told Kathy
... what Mary had said. A week later, Mary told Amanda that she was no
... longer in love with John but was now in love with Ralph. After that,
... Amanda spoke with Kathy about the weather. Who does Kathy think is
... Maryâ€™s love?

Based on the information provided, Kathy thinks that Mary's love is Ralph.

Here's how we can deduce this:

1. Mary told Amanda that she was in love with John. (Fact 1)
2. Amanda told Kathy what Mary had said. (Fact 2)
3. A week later, Mary told Amanda that she was no longer in love with John but was now in love with Ralph. (Fact 3)

Using the information provided, we can create a simple diagram to represent the relationships between the characters and the events:
```
Mary -- love -- John
                   |
Amanda -- tell -- Kathy
                   |
Mary -- tell -- Amanda
                   |
Mary -- love -- Ralph
```
Based on this diagram, we can see that Mary was in love with John, but a week later, she was no longer in love with him and was now in love with Ralph. Since Amanda told 
Kathy about Mary's initial declaration of love for John, Kathy must think that John is Mary's former love interest.
