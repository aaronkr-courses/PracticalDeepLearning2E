Please give me 10 words that are as different from each other as possible, in all meanings and uses of the words. The rules: Only single words in English. Only nouns (e.g., things, objects, concepts). No proper nouns (e.g., no specific people or places). No specialized vocabulary (e.g., no technical terms). Think of the words on your own (e.g., do not just look at objects in your surroundings).
